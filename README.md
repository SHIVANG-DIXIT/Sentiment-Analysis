# Sentiment-Analysis
A Machine Learning project for Tweet Sentiment Analysis. The project preprocesses raw tweet text (removing URLs, stopwords, punctuation) and applies TF-IDF vectorization before training a Logistic Regression model. It classifies tweets into categories (e.g., positive/negative) and evaluates the model using accuracy and classification metrics.
